# Real Time Ruby on Rails Chat App Deployment using Docker Compose
Deploying a Ruby on Rails (RoR) application using Docker and Docker Compose involves creating three key files: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env`. These files work together to containerize the application, manage its dependencies, and configure the environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Amazon RDS for RoR App on EC2

<details>
  <summary>Launching EC2 Instance and RDS for Docker</summary>


### Step 1: Launch the EC2 Instance (if not already created)
1. **Go to EC2 Dashboard** ‚Üí Instances ‚Üí **Launch instance**.
2. Choose Amazon Linux 2 / Ubuntu 22.04.
3. Instance type: e.g., **t2.micro (free tier eligible)**.
4. Create a **new security group** (or select existing):
   - Allow **SSH (port 22)** from your IP.
   - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** from anywhere.
   - Leave HTTPS and other ports closed for now.

---

### Step 2: Create a Security Group for RDS

1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** ‚Üí **Security Groups** ‚Üí **Create Security Group**.
2. Name: `rds-chat-db-sg`
3. Description: Security group for chat app RDS PostgreSQL.
4. VPC: Select the default VPC (or the one EC2 is in).
5. Under **Inbound Rules**, add:
   - **Type**: PostgreSQL
   - **Protocol**: TCP
   - **Port range**: 5432
   - **Source**: Choose ‚Äú**Custom**‚Äù and select your **EC2 security group** (not IP address!). This ensures only your EC2 can connect to the RDS instance.

6. Click **Create Security Group**.

---

### Step 3: Create the RDS PostgreSQL Instance

1. Go to **RDS Dashboard** ‚Üí **Create Database**.
2. Choose:
   - **Standard create**
   - **Engine**: PostgreSQL
   - **Version**: Select a supported version (e.g., 14.x)
3. Settings:
   - DB instance identifier: `chat-app-db`
   - Master username: `myuser`
   - Master password: `mypassword` (store securely)
4. Instance class: `db.t3.micro` (free tier if available)
5. Storage: Leave default (or increase as needed).
6. Connectivity:
   - **VPC**: Same VPC as EC2
   - **Public access**: **No** (for best security; or Yes if you want to test with pgAdmin later)
   - **VPC security group**: **Select existing**, and choose `rds-chat-db-sg`
7. Database options:
   - Initial DB name: `chat_app_production`

8. Click **Create database**

RDS will take a few minutes to initialize.

---

### Step 4: Modify EC2 Security Group (if needed)

Modify EC2 Security Group to Allow Outbound PostgreSQL
By default, EC2 security groups allow all outbound traffic. If you've restricted outbound, make sure to allow this:

Go to ec2-sg ‚Üí Outbound Rules ‚Üí Ensure:

Type: PostgreSQL

Port: 5432

Destination: rds-sg (or just All traffic for development)

---

### Step 5: Connect to RDS from EC2 (Test)

SSH into EC2:

```bash
psql -h <your-rds-endpoint> -U myuser -d chat_app_production -W
```

Replace `<your-rds-endpoint>` with something like:
```
chat-app-db.xxxxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

If it connects, you're good!

---

### Step 6: Update Rails `.env` File

On your EC2, edit `.env` inside your Rails app:

```bash
vi /home/ubuntu/chat-app/.env
```

Update the `DATABASE_URL`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@<your-rds-endpoint>:5432/chat_app_production
```

---

### Step 7: Finalize Rails Configuration

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/chat-app/
bundle install
RAILS_ENV=production rails db:migrate
rails assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
```

</details>

 **Done!** We now have:
- RDS PostgreSQL securely set up.
- EC2 and RDS allowed to communicate.
- Your Rails app ready to use a remote, scalable database.

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide (Rails + Docker + PostgreSQL AWS-RDS + Redis + NGINX{Reverse Proxy})

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Rails app ready (you already have it)
- `.env` file with production secrets
- Puma configured in `config/puma.rb`

---

## üóÇ Project Structure

Make sure your Rails app folder looks like this:

```
chat-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ puma.rb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default.conf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Step 1: Update Package Index and Install Prerequisites
[Set up Docker & Docker-Compose Setup on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://github.com/Mallick17/Docker/tree/Docekr_Installation#docker--docker-compose-setup-on-ubuntu-2204-lts)

<details>
  <summary>Or Follow the steps below</summary>

### Step 1: Update Package Index and Install Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
```

**Why?**  
`apt-get update`: Ensures the latest package versions are available.  
`apt-get install`: Installs `ca-certificates` (for HTTPS) and `curl` (for downloading files).

---

### Step 2: Set Up Docker's GPG Key

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

**Why?**  
Creates a directory for the GPG key, downloads Docker‚Äôs official key, and sets read permissions for package verification.

---

### Step 3: Add Docker's Repository

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo \"${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}\") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

**Why?**  
Adds Docker‚Äôs repository to the system‚Äôs package sources, specifying the architecture and Ubuntu version.

---

### Step 4: Install Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

**Why?**  
Installs Docker components and the Docker Compose binary (version 2.20.2) for orchestrating containers.

---

### Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
docker -v
docker-compose -v
```

**Why?**  
Displays the versions of Docker and Docker Compose to verify successful installation.

---
  
</details>
---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mallick17/Real-Time_Ruby_on_Rails_Chat_App_Deployment.git
cd chat-app/
```

**Why?**  
- `git clone ...`: Clones the repository containing the RoR chat application to the current directory.
- `cd chat-app/`: Navigates into the cloned repository directory, where the application files (e.g., Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) are located.

---

### üîê Step 3: Configure or Edit `.env` File
The `.env` file contains environment variables that configure the RoR application and are used by Docker Compose. 

```bash
vi .env
```

**Why?**  
- Configures variables like database credentials. Example `.env`:

<details>
  <summary>Click to view .env file</summary>


ubuntu@ip-172-31-44-76:~/chat-app$ cat .env
```env
# **RAILS_ENV=production**
## Set the Rails environment to production,
## affecting how the app behaves,
## such as enabling caching and detailed error reporting.
RAILS_ENV=production

# Database connection details for your RDS
## Explanation: These variables hold the credentials and connection details for a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS.
## They are used to construct the `DATABASE_URL` in `docker-compose.yml`.
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_HOST=chat-app.c342ea4cs6ny.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=chat-app

# Redis config
## Specifies the Redis connection URL, pointing to the `redis` service on port 6379,
## database 0. This is redundant with the `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`,
## but ensures consistency.
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# Security Keys
## These are secret keys used by Rails for decrypting credentials (`RAILS_MASTER_KEY`)
## and cryptographic purposes like signing cookies (`SECRET_KEY_BASE`).
## They must be kept secure and not committed to version control.
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=c3ca922688d4bf22ac7fe38430dd8849
SECRET_KEY_BASE=600f21de02355f788c759ff862a2cb22ba84ccbf072487992f4c2c49ae260f87c7593a1f5f6cf2e45457c76994779a8b30014ee9597e35a2818ca91e33bb7233

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Create `Dockerfile`
The Dockerfile specifies the steps to create the application‚Äôs Docker image. A typical Dockerfile for a RoR application might look like this which is provided below: 
- Edit the Dockerfile to define how the application container is built.

```bash
vi Dockerfile
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Dockerfile</summary>

ubuntu@ip-172-31-44-76:~/chat-app$ cat Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM ruby:3.2.2
## This pulls the official Ruby 3.2.2 image from Docker Hub (Docker Hub),
## which includes Ruby and a Debian-based Linux environment.
## This is the foundation for the container, ensuring compatibility with the RoR applica                                                                                                tion.

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

## Sets the working directory inside the container to /app,
## where all subsequent commands will execute.
## This is where the application code will reside,
## following best practices for organization.

# Install packages
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs curl redis

## Updates the package list quietly (-qq) and installs essential packages:
### build-essential: Provides compilers and libraries (e.g., gcc, make) needed for building software.
### libpq-dev: Development files for PostgreSQL, required for the pg gem used in Rails for database connectivity.
### nodejs: JavaScript runtime, necessary for asset compilation (e.g., Webpacker or Sprockets).
### curl: A tool for transferring data, used here for installing additional tools like Yarn.
## redis: Installs the Redis server, likely used for caching or real-time features like ActionCable.
## This step ensures the container has all system-level dependencies for the RoR app.

# Install Yarn
RUN curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add - \
  && echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list \
  && apt-get update && apt-get install -y yarn

## Installs Yarn, a package manager for JavaScript, which is often used in Rails for managing frontend dependencies:
### First, adds the Yarn GPG key for secure package verification.
### Adds the Yarn repository to the sources list.
### Updates the package list and installs Yarn.
## This is crucial for applications using JavaScript frameworks or asset pipelines.

# Install bundler
RUN gem install bundler

## Installs Bundler, the Ruby dependency manager,
## which reads the Gemfile to install gems.
## This ensures the RoR application has all required Ruby libraries.

# Copy Gemfiles and install dependencies
COPY Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

## Copies the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to the container,
## then runs bundle install to install the gems specified.
## This step is done early to leverage Docker layer caching,
## improving build times if the Gemfile doesn't change.

# Copy rest of the application
COPY . .
## Copies the entire application code from the host to the container's /app directory.
## This includes all source files, configurations, and assets.

# Ensure tmp directories exist
RUN mkdir -p tmp/pids tmp/cache tmp/sockets log
## Creates directories for temporary files, cache, sockets, and logs.
## The -p flag ensures parent directories are created if they don't exist,
## preventing errors. These directories are standard for Rails applications,
## used by Puma and other processes.


# Precompile assets (optional for production)
RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

## Precompiles assets (CSS, JavaScript) for production using the rake
## assets:precompile task. This step is optional but recommended for production
## to improve performance by serving precompiled assets, reducing server load.

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 3000

## Informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000 at runtime.
## This is the default port for Rails applications using Puma,
## making it accessible externally when mapped.

# Start the app with Puma
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "puma", "-C", "config/puma.rb"]

## Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
## It uses Bundler to execute Puma, the web server for Rails,
## with the configuration file config/puma.rb.
## This starts the application, listening on port 3000.

```

</details>

---

## üß± Step 5: Create `docker-compose.yml`
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines and orchestrates the services needed for the application, ensuring they communicate and start in the correct order. It uses version 3.8 of the Compose file format for modern features.

```bash
vi docker-compose.yml
```
### Explanation of key sections:
- version: '3.8': Specifies the Docker Compose file format.
- services.web: Defines the Rails application service.
- build: .: Builds the image using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
- command: Removes any stale server PID and starts the Rails server.
- volumes: Mounts the local directory to /app in the container for code synchronization.
- ports: Maps port 3000 on the host to 3000 in the container.
- depends_on: Ensures the database starts before the web service.
- environment: Sets the Rails environment to production.

- services.db: Defines the PostgreSQL database service.
- image: postgres:14: Uses the official PostgreSQL 14 image.
- volumes: Persists database data using a named volume.
- environment: Configures database credentials and name.

- volumes: Defines a named volume (postgres_data) for persistent storage.

```

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Click to view the explained docker-compose.yml</summary>

- **Version and Services**:
  - Command: `version: '3.8'`
  - Explanation: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version, ensuring compatibility with recent Docker features.

- **Web Service Configuration**:
  - **Build**: `build: .`
    - Explanation: Instructs Docker Compose to build the image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`).
  - **Image**: `image: chat-app:latest`
    - Explanation: Names the built image `chat-app:latest`, making it identifiable for future use or deployment.
  - **Command**: `command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"`
    - Explanation: Overrides the default command from the `Dockerfile`. It runs a bash command that:
      - Removes any existing server PID file (`rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid`) to prevent conflicts if the server was previously running.
      - Starts Puma with the configuration file `config/puma.rb` using Bundler.
    - This ensures a clean start, avoiding issues like "address already in use."
  - **Volumes**: `volumes: - .:/app`
    - Explanation: Mounts the current directory (`.`) on the host to `/app` in the container. This allows for live code changes to be reflected inside the container without rebuilding, useful for development but should be handled carefully in production for security.
  - **Ports**: `ports: - "3000:3000"`
    - Explanation: Maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container, making the RoR application accessible at `localhost:3000` or the server's IP on port 3000.
  - **Environment Files**: `env_file: - .env`
    - Explanation: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file, which includes database credentials, Redis URL, and secret keys, into the container.
  - **Environment Variables**: `environment: RAILS_ENV: production DATABASE_URL: postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME} REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0`
    - Explanation: Sets specific environment variables:
      - `RAILS_ENV: production`: Ensures the Rails application runs in production mode, affecting caching, logging, and error reporting.
      - `DATABASE_URL`: Constructs the PostgreSQL connection URL using variables from `.env`, enabling the app to connect to the RDS instance.
      - `REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0`: Sets the Redis connection to point to the `redis` service on port 6379, using the default database 0.
    - Note: The `REDIS_URL` is also in `.env`, but this explicitly sets it, potentially overriding for clarity.
  - **Dependencies**: `depends_on: - redis`
    - Explanation: Ensures the `redis` service starts before the `web` service. This is crucial for applications relying on Redis, like for caching or ActionCable, though it doesn't guarantee Redis is fully ready (additional health checks may be needed).
  - **Restart Policy**: `restart: always`
    - Explanation: Configures the container to always restart if it stops, ensuring uptime, which is suitable for production environments.

- **Redis Service Configuration**:
  - **Image**: `image: redis:7`
    - Explanation: Uses the official Redis 7 image from Docker Hub ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)), providing an in-memory data store for caching or real-time features.
  - **Container Name**: `container_name: redis`
    - Explanation: Names the container `redis`, making it easier to identify and manage.
  - **Restart Policy**: `restart: always`
    - Explanation: Ensures the Redis container restarts if it stops, maintaining availability.
  - **Ports**: `ports: - "6379:6379"`
    - Explanation: Maps port 6379 on the host to port 6379 in the container, allowing external access to Redis if needed, though in production, this might be restricted for security.

## üß± Step 6: Create `nginx/default.conf`
The `default.cong` file defines and orchestrates the nginx services as reverse proxy by listening to port `80` and transfering the request to port `3000`

```bash
vi nginx/default.conf
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view default.conf file</summary>

root@ip-172-31-12-255:~/chat-app/nginx# cat default.conf
```conf
upstream app {
    server web:3000;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://app;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## üß± Step 8: Build and Run Containers
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a68eb86-70da-46e7-b163-207831eb541a)

**Why?**  
- `sudo docker-compose up`: Starts the services defined in docker-compose.yml.
- `--build`: Forces Docker to rebuild the images, ensuring any changes in the Dockerfile or application code are applied.
- `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).
- This command builds the web service image, pulls the PostgreSQL image, and starts both containers.

---

### Step 8: Verify Containers

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

**Why?**  
- `docker ps`: Lists running containers, showing their IDs, names, ports, and status. If run without sudo and permission is denied, use sudo docker ps.
- Expected output includes the web and db services, with ports like `0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp` for the web service.

---

### Step 9: Access Web Container

```bash
sudo docker-compose exec web bash
```

**Why?**  
- Provides a shell to run commands inside the container.
- `sudo docker-compose exec web bash`: Opens a bash shell inside the running web container, allowing you to run commands like asset precompilation or database migrations.
- This is necessary for tasks that must be executed within the container‚Äôs environment.

---

### Step 10: Precompile Assets
Inside the web container, precompile Rails assets for production.

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

**Why?**  
- Compiles CSS and JavaScript for optimized serving in production.
- `RAILS_ENV=production`: Sets the environment to production, ensuring assets are optimized.
- `bundle exec rake assets:precompile`: Compiles assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) into public/assets, which are served statically in production. This step is critical for performance and compatibility.

---

### Step 11: Set Up Database
Create, migrate, and seed the database inside the web container.

```bash
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

**Why?**  
- Initializes the database, applies schema migrations, and seeds initial data.
- `bundle exec rails db:create`: Creates the database specified in `database.yml` (e.g., chat_app).
- `db:migrate`: Applies database migrations to set up the schema.
- `db:seed`: Populates the database with initial data (if db/seeds.rb exists).
- These commands ensure the database is ready for the application.

---

### Step 12: Monitor Logs
Check the application logs to verify functionality or debug issues.

```bash
cd log/
cat production.log
```

**Why?**  
- Displays application activity to verify functionality or diagnose issues.
- `cd log/`: Navigates to the directory containing log files.
- `cat production.log`: Displays the contents of the production log, which records application activity (e.g., requests, errors). This helps verify that the application is running correctly.

## Verifying the Deployment

- **Access the App**: Visit `http://<server-ip>:3000` in a browser.
- **Check Containers**: Run `sudo docker ps` to verify services.
- **View Logs**:  
  ```bash
  sudo docker-compose logs web
  cat log/production.log
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**:  
  Add user to Docker group:  
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```

- **Database Errors**:  
  Verify `DATABASE_URL` matches `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Asset Issues**:  
  Confirm `assets:precompile` succeeded (check `public/assets`).

- **Port Conflicts**:  
  Check port 3000:  
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tuln | grep 3000
  ```

## Errors Faced while creating Docker Images
<details>
  <summary>Click to view all the errors</summary>


1.The error is clear:

‚ùå Missing secret_key_base for 'production' environment

This happens because during Docker build time, Rails is trying to precompile assets in production mode, but the necessary secret (SECRET_KEY_BASE or RAILS_MASTER_KEY) isn‚Äôt available in the environment inside the Docker build.
-----------------------------------------------------
2. Ah, I see what‚Äôs happening ‚Äî the error:

cpp
Copy
Edit
URI::InvalidURIError: bad URI(is not URI?): DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@chat-app.c342ea4cs6ny.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/chat-app
means your Rails app is trying to parse the whole string DATABASE_URL=... as a URI, instead of just the actual URL value.

That usually happens when the .env file contains quotes or spaces or is malformed. Let‚Äôs fix that.
-----------------------------------------------------
3. Nice! Your Rails app is running inside the Docker container and it‚Äôs successfully **precompiling and writing the assets**. That whole chunk of logs shows the asset pipeline doing its thing‚Äîgenerating all the necessary `.js`, `.css`, and image files for production mode.

The next thing to check is:

1. **Is the Puma server running?**  
   After the assets are compiled, Puma (or whichever server your app is configured to use) should start. Look for a line that says something like:
   ```
   * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
   ```
   or
   ```
   [Puma starting in production environment...]
   ```

2. **Can you access the app in your browser?**  
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser (or `http://<your-docker-host>:3000` if you‚Äôre not on localhost). Do you see your app running?

---

If nothing is loading or you‚Äôre unsure if Puma actually started, it could be a case where the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` in your Dockerfile is not launching the server properly.

Let‚Äôs check that by doing either:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

or if it exited:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Let me know if it says the server is listening or if it exited with an error‚Äîwe‚Äôll troubleshoot from there.

-----------------------------------------------------
4. You're super close to getting this running! Here's what's going on and how to fix it:

---

### üî• Problem Summary

1. **Puma Error:**  
   ```
   No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - tmp/pids/server.pid
   ```
   Puma is trying to write its PID file to `tmp/pids/server.pid`, but that directory doesn't exist in your container.

2. **No Running Container:**  
   ```
   sudo docker ps
   ```
   Output is empty ‚Äî meaning your container started but then crashed (because of the error above).

---

### ‚úÖ Solution

#### 1. **Ensure `tmp/pids` directory exists in your app**
This is the root of the crash. Puma can't write the PID file if the directory isn't there.

**Fix in your Dockerfile or `entrypoint.sh` (whichever you use):**

```bash
RUN mkdir -p tmp/pids
```

OR add it in your `Dockerfile` before starting Puma:

```Dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /app/tmp/pids
```

If you're using a `docker-compose.yml`, you can also add a command like:

```yaml
command: bash -c "mkdir -p tmp/pids && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"
```

---

#### 2. **Rebuild and Restart Your Container**
Once the fix is added:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

---

#### 3. **Docker Permission Fix (optional for quality-of-life)**  
You're getting:

```
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

To fix that permanently (instead of always using `sudo`), run:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then **logout and log back in** (or `exec su -l $USER`) to apply the group change.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs get your Rails app running in Docker with a fixed and production-ready setup. Below is an updated `Dockerfile`, a working `docker-compose.yml`, and **step-by-step instructions** to get your app running.

---

## ‚úÖ UPDATED `Dockerfile`

Here‚Äôs a safe and efficient `Dockerfile` for production:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM ruby:3.2.2

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install packages
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs curl

# Install Yarn
RUN curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add - \
  && echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list \
  && apt-get update && apt-get install -y yarn

# Install bundler
RUN gem install bundler

# Copy Gemfiles and install dependencies
COPY Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

# Copy rest of the application
COPY . .

# Ensure tmp directories exist
RUN mkdir -p tmp/pids tmp/cache tmp/sockets log

# Precompile assets (optional for production)
RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app with Puma
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "puma", "-C", "config/puma.rb"]
```

---

## ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yml`

For local dev or basic deployment (non-Kubernetes), use:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/chat_app_production

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: chat_app_production
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db_data:
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

> Be sure to run these from inside your `chat-app` directory.

### üîß 1. Fix Puma issue

Ensure `tmp/pids/` is created in the Docker build. It‚Äôs handled in the Dockerfile above. You don't need to manually do anything if you're using the updated file.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Build and Run Docker Compose

```bash
sudo docker-compose down        # Stop any old containers
sudo docker-compose up --build  # Rebuild everything clean
```

---

### üöÄ 3. Check If It's Running

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000
```

(Use `curl ifconfig.me` or check your EC2 dashboard for the public IP)

---

### üêò 4. (Optional) Run Database Migrations

Inside the running container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose exec web bash
# Inside container:
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

---

### üßπ 5. Optional: Fix Docker Permission

Run this once on your EC2 to avoid needing `sudo` every time:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
exec su -l $USER  # or logout/login
```

---

Would you like me to also help convert this to your `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Ah got it ‚Äî since your Rails app is using **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**, we don‚Äôt want to use the `db` service in Docker Compose at all. Instead, you‚Äôll configure the connection directly to your RDS instance.

Here‚Äôs how to modify the setup accordingly:

---

## ‚úÖ Updated `docker-compose.yml` (for RDS)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://<username>:<password>@<rds-endpoint>:5432/<dbname>
```

Replace:

- `<username>` ‚Äì your RDS DB username
- `<password>` ‚Äì your RDS DB password
- `<rds-endpoint>` ‚Äì something like `your-db.xxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- `<dbname>` ‚Äì your production database name

üëâ **No `db` service needed**, since RDS is external.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions (RDS Version)

### 1. üë∑ Update `.env.production` or use `.env`

To avoid hardcoding credentials, add an `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://youruser:yourpassword@your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
RAILS_ENV=production
```

Then in `docker-compose.yml`, load it:

```yaml
    env_file:
      - .env
```

---

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run with Compose

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

---

### 3. üöÄ Migrate the RDS DB

```bash
sudo docker-compose exec web bash
# Then inside the container:
bundle exec rails db:migrate db:seed
```

---

### 4. üì° Check App Is Running

```bash
curl http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000
```

Or hit it in the browser.

---

Would you like me to update your `docker-compose.prod.yml` too for best practices? Or help you set up secrets and env securely for EC2 production?

+------------------------------------------------------------------
7.Here‚Äôs a complete and clean **`docker-compose.yml`** for your production Rails app using **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**:

---

### ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yml` (Production + RDS)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: chat-app:latest
    command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
    depends_on: []
    restart: always
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example `.env` file (Do **not** commit this to Git)

```env
RAILS_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgres://youruser:yourpassword@your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-secret-key-base
```

You can generate `SECRET_KEY_BASE` like this:

```bash
rails secret
```

---

### ‚úÖ Dockerfile (just confirming ‚Äî make sure it looks like this)

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.2.2

WORKDIR /app

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install --without development test

COPY . .

RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["bash", "-c", "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"]
```

---

### ‚úÖ Next Steps to Run

1. **Build & Start the container**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Run DB Migrations**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose exec web bash
   # inside container:
   bundle exec rails db:migrate db:seed
   ```

3. **Visit your app**
   - `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000`

---

Want to auto-start this on reboot with systemd, or run Nginx as a reverse proxy on port 80 next?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. That `favicon.ico` error is completely harmless and very common ‚Äî browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico`, and if your app doesn‚Äôt have that route or file, Rails throws a `RoutingError`. But it doesn‚Äôt break anything.

---

### ‚úÖ Here's What You Can Do to Fix It (Optional)

#### Option 1: Add a favicon

Just place a `favicon.ico` file inside your app‚Äôs `public/` directory. Rails will serve it statically.

```bash
# Example: download and move a favicon
wget https://www.google.com/favicon.ico -O public/favicon.ico
```

Or create your own favicon and place it in `public/favicon.ico`.

---

#### Option 2: Ignore the error

If you don‚Äôt care about the icon (e.g. for admin apps or APIs), you can leave it alone. The error only appears in logs and doesn‚Äôt affect app behavior.

---

Let me know if you want help customizing your favicon or adding one dynamically with a Rails helper. Also ‚Äî do you want help setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy on EC2 to serve your app via `http://yourdomain.com` on port 80 or 443?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Awesome ‚Äî setting up **Nginx as a reverse proxy** is a great move for production Rails apps. It‚Äôll listen on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS) and forward requests to your Rails app running on a Docker container (usually on port 3000). Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for your setup.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step: Setup Nginx as a Reverse Proxy for Rails (Docker)**

#### **1. Install Nginx (on your EC2 instance)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

---

#### **2. Configure a New Nginx Site**

Create a new config file for your app:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/chat-app
```

Paste this config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Replace with your domain or public IP

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;  # Rails app running in Docker on port 3000
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /favicon.ico {
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html;
}
```

---

#### **3. Enable the Site**

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/chat-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Optional: Remove the default config if needed:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

---

#### **4. Test and Restart Nginx**

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

#### **5. Allow Port 80 (if not already allowed)**

If you‚Äôre using EC2, make sure **port 80 is open** in your **Security Group** settings.

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus: Use Your Domain

If you're using a domain, point your **DNS A record** to the EC2 public IP address. It can take a few minutes to propagate.

---

### ‚úÖ Optional: Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Want HTTPS? I can walk you through adding a free SSL certificate using **Certbot** ‚Äî just say the word!

---

Would you like to set up SSL next or test your app now over HTTP first?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Alright ‚Äî the error you're seeing means that Rails is trying to **migrate and seed the database**, but the database named `chat-app` **doesn't exist yet** in your **RDS instance**. You're almost there!

Let me guide you step-by-step to fix this:

---

### ‚úÖ **Fix: Create the Database in RDS**

Since the app connects to an RDS PostgreSQL instance, and it says:

```
FATAL:  database "chat-app" does not exist
```

You simply need to **create the database manually** or via Rails.

---

### üõ† Option 1: Use Rails to create the database

If the RDS user (in your `config/database.yml`) has permission to create a database:

```bash
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

But most RDS setups **don‚Äôt allow creating a new database from the app**, so you‚Äôll likely need to do:

---

### üõ† Option 2: Create the Database Manually in RDS

1. **Connect to your RDS instance via `psql`:**

```bash
psql -h <your-rds-endpoint> -U <username> -d postgres
```

Replace:
- `<your-rds-endpoint>` = your actual RDS hostname
- `<username>` = your master username

Example:

```bash
psql -h mydb.abc123xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U mydbuser -d postgres
```

You'll be prompted for your password.

---

2. **Create the database:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "chat-app";
```

Note: Use **double quotes** if the name includes a dash (`-`), otherwise Postgres thinks it's two words.

---

3. **Exit and run migrations from Docker:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash
bundle exec rails db:migrate db:seed
```

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus Tip: Rename Database to Avoid Dashes (Recommended)

PostgreSQL doesn't love hyphens (`-`) in database names ‚Äî Rails will treat it like `"chat-app"` (quoted string). If you can, rename it in `database.yml` to something like:

```yaml
database: chat_app
```

Then create that database instead:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE chat_app;
```

And update the DB on RDS accordingly.

---

Let me know your database name preference (keep `chat-app` or switch to `chat_app`), and I‚Äôll adjust the `database.yml` and walk you through it cleanly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Yes ‚Äî that `REDIS_URL` value is likely what's causing the **ArgumentError**, because it's **not in the correct format**.

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Format for `REDIS_URL`

It should be a **valid URI**, not just a hostname and port. The correct format is:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

Or if you're using Docker and Redis is running as a **container service**, then you‚Äôd use the **service name** from `docker-compose.yml`, like:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

> Replace `redis` with whatever the Redis service is named in your `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### üîç TL;DR ‚Äî Fix `.env`

Update your `.env` to:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

Or (Docker example):

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

Then restart your Rails app container so it picks up the new `.env` values:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Let me know if you want me to inspect your `docker-compose.yml` to make sure Redis is set up correctly too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Your Rails app is throwing this error when attempting to run `MessageBroadcastJob`:

```
Redis::CannotConnectError (Error connecting to Redis on localhost:6379 (Errno::ECONNREFUSED))
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Cause:
The job is trying to publish to Redis (used by ActionCable) but Redis is **not running** or **not reachable** at `localhost:6379` inside your container.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution

Since you‚Äôre using **Docker**, here's how to get Redis working:

---

### 1. **Add Redis service to your Docker Compose file**

Update your `docker-compose.yml` to include Redis:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/1

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    ...

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

> Note the `REDIS_URL` uses `redis://redis:6379/1`, where `redis` is the service name.

---

### 2. **Update `cable.yml` to use the Redis service**

Edit `config/cable.yml`:

```yaml
production:
  adapter: redis
  url: <%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379/1") %>

development:
  adapter: redis
  url: <%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379/1") %>
```

---

### 3. **Ensure `config/environments/production.rb` has Action Cable host and allowed origins set**

```ruby
config.action_cable.url = "wss://your-domain.com/cable"
config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = [ "https://your-domain.com", "http://localhost:3000" ]
```

> For local dev, `ws://localhost:3000/cable` works fine.

---

### 4. **Rebuild and start everything**

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### ‚úÖ Optional: Verify Redis is working

Inside your `web` container:

```bash
docker-compose exec web rails c
```

Then:

```ruby
Redis.new(url: ENV['REDIS_URL']).ping
# => "PONG"
```

---

Let me know if you want to run Redis outside of Docker (e.g., on your host machine) instead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Great idea! Adding Redis is often useful for background jobs (e.g., with Sidekiq) or caching in Rails.

Here's your **updated `docker-compose.yml`** with a `redis` service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: chat-app:latest
    command: bash -c "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid && bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      RAILS_ENV: production
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0
    depends_on:
      - redis
    restart: always

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    container_name: redis
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

### Notes:
- `REDIS_URL` is now passed to the `web` service so Rails/Sidekiq can connect.
- Redis container is named `redis`, and the hostname `redis` is used in the URL thanks to Docker Compose's internal DNS.
- Port `6379` is exposed, which is optional unless you want to connect to Redis from your host machine (e.g., for debugging).

Let me know if you're using Sidekiq or ActionCable with Redis, or want Redis password protection added too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.Thanks for sharing that ‚Äî from the logs, it looks like your web container (`chat-app-web-1`) is **crashing and restarting repeatedly**, and the main warning is this:

```
The "DB_USER" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
```

That‚Äôs a red flag. Your `docker-compose.yml` expects database-related environment variables, but they aren‚Äôt being passed ‚Äî likely because your `.env` file is missing or doesn't have the correct values.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix Steps

1. **Create or update your `.env` file** in your project root (`~/chat-app/.env`), and define all the required environment variables:

```env
RAILS_ENV=production

# Database connection details for your RDS
DB_USER=your_rds_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_rds_password
DB_HOST=your-rds-endpoint.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Optional: Redis config if needed
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

> Replace the values with your actual RDS settings. You can get the RDS endpoint from the AWS console.

---

2. **Verify `.env` is actually being picked up**  
Double-check your `docker-compose.yml` contains this line under the `web` service:
```yaml
env_file:
  - .env
```

---

3. **Rebuild and restart your services**:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

Then run:
```bash
sudo docker-compose logs web
```

To see what‚Äôs happening in the web container. If there‚Äôs still a crash, paste that log here.
